## Application Exercise 3

The project began by choosing our data set, this dataset contains information about 957 Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2017. This information includes the Nobel laureate’s name, birth and death date (if applicable), birth and death location (plus **latitude and longitude coordinates** for the locations), the year they won the Nobel Prize, the category of the Nobel Prize, and the “motivation” for the Nobel Prize.

Next, the data was cleaned and formatted so that it could be used for analysis.

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
data <- read.csv("/cloud/project/nobel-prize-winners-1.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE,fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
data <- data[!duplicated(data), ]
colnames(data) <- tolower(gsub(" ", "_", colnames(data)))
data$name <- gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", data$name)
data <- data %>% select(-c(bornlocation, diedlocation, borncoordinates, diedcoordinates, 
                           borncountry_now, borncity_now, diedcountry_now, diedcity_now))
data <- data %>% rename(
  borncountry = borncountry_original,
  borncity = borncity_original,
  diedcity = diedcity_original,
  diedcountry = diedcountry_original
)
data[data == ""] <- NA
data <- drop_na(data)
data[] <- lapply(data, function(x) if (is.character(x)) iconv(x, from = "UTF-8", to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT") else x)
write.csv(data, "/cloud/project/nobel-prize-winners-1_cleaned.csv", 
          row.names = FALSE, fileEncoding = "UTF-8")

```

After the data had been cleaned, the file was able to be fed into [coconut-libtool](https://www.coconut-libtool.com/the-app) for analysis. This tool can be found at the URL <https://www.coconut-libtool.com/home>.![](images/Screenshot 2025-03-15 155952.png){width="590"}

First, the file is fed into a file checker, which verifies the format of the cvs file and gives the user options on what type of text analysis should be used on the data.

![Once the type of text analysis you would like to use has been verified, the start analyzing option on the home page will ask which option we would like to use. It is important to use one of the text analysis options that has been verified for the cvs file in use. ](images/clipboard-1242982675.png)

After selecting Topic Modeling, the program will ask to be fed the data set again. When the data has been recognized, the metrics and methods to manipulate the data can be selected to generate the model.

![For the model Biterm method chosen here, the column chosen to be analyzed was borncountry, or what country the Nobel Prize winners were born in. After plugging this into our program, we are shown different graphs that can be manipulated for more information. Here we can see two different graphs that describe the probability of which country produced a Nobel Prize winner in this data set. ](images/clipboard-1699669049.png)
